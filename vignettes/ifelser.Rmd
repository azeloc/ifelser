ifelser is an R package created to make nested ifelse statements easier and in modern R way to write code.

## Simple ifelse statement

A simple vectorized ifelse statement can be done like this with `ifelser`

```{r}
library(ifelser)
x <- 1:10
test_if(x > 5) %>% if_true(1) %>% if_false(0)
```

## More complicated statements

Sometimes you want to nest statments. This can be done using the following commands:

```{r}
test_if(x>5) %>% if_true(1) %>% if_false() %>% 
  test_if(x<2) %>% if_true(5) %>% if_false(0)
```

If you ommit `if_false` or `if_true` arguments, `ifelser` will wait for another call for `test_if`, meaning that you want to nest an ifelse statement. This can be done how many times you want.
